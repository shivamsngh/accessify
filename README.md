# Accessify: An ML Powered Solution for Accessible Web

Accessify is built with latest ES6 features. It is compiled with Babel to be backwards compatible.

Make sure latest stable [Node.js](https://node.org) version is installed on your system.

Clone the repo and start using


```
git clone https://github.com/shivamsngh/accessify.git
cd accessify
npm install
```

Then build the source using 
```
npm run build
```
This will create a new dist folder.

Full documentation and descriptions coming soon.
